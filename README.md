# Nomad track
The notes in the track will not be visible in arcade mode, so they are more for reference while building the challenges.

The challenges are running on a g1-small VM so nomad can have full privileges.
Consul and Nomad are already set up on the VM and are bootstrapped in the setup of the first challenge.
